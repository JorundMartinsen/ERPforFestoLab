# ERPforFestoLab
School project. This software registers orders to an SQL-server. 

When the order has been manufactured, an invoice can be created. 

The S.M.A.R.T-lab selected small jars of varying color and size, filled the jar with water, placed a cap on it, 
weighed them for quality control and placed the finished jars on a tray.

The rig included three Siemens S7-1500 PLC's, a mitsubishi robot and an arduino board.

In addition to program the ERP, the group also programmed the PLC's, robot and Arduino, in addition 
to a separate project where we set up an Active Directory server.
